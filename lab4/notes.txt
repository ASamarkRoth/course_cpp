Notes lab 4

Recall an iterator is just a special pointer, and thus if you want to access element one just uses the dereference operator.

Inheritance:
setting class method = 0 means that it is pure virtual!

destructor = default ->
It means that you want to use the compiler-generated version of that function, so you don't need to specify a body.

A derived class must include in its own class body a declaration of all the virtual functions it intends to define itself.
A derived virtual method which intended for definition can be noted override (after its parameter list in .h)

"Slicing" is where you assign an object of a derived class to an instance of a base class, thereby losing part of the information - some of it is "sliced" away.

public, private and protected inheritance:
public keeps the keyword structure in the derived class the same as the base class (most important)
private - all members in the derived class are private


Hash table:
(as an unordered_map): <key, value>
Hash function: Hash(key) -> index number, where value to key is
Collisions: many keys are directed to a common index number
Chaining: linking common index numbers in a list
table: how the index numbers are "stored"
Determine table_size and the index number as the modulus of (sum(chars) % table_size this is one type of hash function
Index numbers of a hash table are called buckets!


REMEMBER:
Pass the variable by reference to avoid a copy! Could be very valuable when high performance computing.
